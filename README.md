#  College Mentorship Platform

A MERN stack-based **college mentorship platform** where students can connect with mentors from their college, book sessions for guidance, and learn from their valuable experiences.

##  Problem Statement

Students, especially during their college years, often struggle to find **reliable and personalized guidance** for career growth, interview preparation, and skill development.  
While platforms like LinkedIn exist, they are too broad and not specifically tailored for **college-level peer-to-peer mentorship**.

In most colleges:
- Juniors lack easy access to seniors who have gone through **on-campus placement processes**.
- There is no **centralized system** to learn about different companies’ recruitment patterns.
- Students are unaware of **what specific skills** and **interview topics** a company focuses on.

Our platform aims to solve this by:
- **Connecting students with mentors** (seniors or alumni) for **one-on-one guidance**.
- Allowing mentors to **share their on-campus placement experiences** through blogs.
- Providing students with **insights into the recruitment process** of different companies.
- Offering **filters** to easily find mentors based on branch, graduation year, company, or specialization.
